1.How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?

a. var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };

b. var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

To compare whether two JSON objects have the same properties regardless of the order of properties, you can follow these steps:

1.Convert JSON Objects to Strings: Convert both JSON objects into strings. This helps in disregarding the property order and focuses only on the content.

2.Compare the Strings: Compare the string representations of both objects.

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age: 5 };
var obj2 = { age: 5, name: "Person 1" };

// Step 1: Convert JSON objects to strings
var obj1String = JSON.stringify(obj1);
var obj2String = JSON.stringify(obj2);

// Step 2: Compare the strings
if (obj1String === obj2String) {
    console.log("Objects have the same properties.");
} else {
    console.log("Objects do not have the same properties.");
}

To compare whether two JSON objects have the same properties regardless of the order of properties, you can follow these steps:

Convert JSON Objects to Strings: Convert both JSON objects into strings. This helps in disregarding the property order and focuses only on the content.

Compare the Strings: Compare the string representations of both objects.

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age: 5 };
var obj2 = { age: 5, name: "Person 1" };

// Step 1: Convert JSON objects to strings
var obj1String = JSON.stringify(obj1);
var obj2String = JSON.stringify(obj2);

// Step 2: Compare the strings
if (obj1String === obj2String) {
    console.log("Objects have the same properties.");
} else {
    console.log("Objects do not have the same properties.");
}
Explanation:
JSON.stringify(): This method converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. It serializes the object in a way that the order of properties does not matter as long as the content is the same.

Comparison: By comparing obj1String and obj2String, you are effectively checking if the two objects have the same properties and values.

Example Output:
Given the example objects obj1 and obj2, the output of the above code will be:

Objects have the same properties.

This approach ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the objects rather than their property order. It's a straightforward and effective way to handle JSON comparison in JavaScript.

// Fetch data from the REST Countries API
fetch('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all')
  .then(response => {
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    // Parse JSON data
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Iterate through each country object in the response
    data.forEach(country => {
      // Check if the country has a flag
      if (country.flags) {
        console.log(country.flags.png); // Print the URL of the flag
      }
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was a problem fetching the data:', error);
  });

  Explanation:
1.Fetch API: We use fetch to make a GET request to the provided API endpoint (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all). This returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the server.

2.Response Handling:
We check if the response is successful (response.ok). If not, an error is thrown.
If successful, we parse the response body as JSON using response.json(), which returns another Promise.

3.Data Processing:
Once we have the JSON data (data), we iterate through each country object using forEach.
For each country, we check if country.flags exists (to ensure the country has a flag).
If country.flags exists, we log country.flags.png, which gives us the URL of the flag image.

4.Error Handling:
If there are any errors during the fetch or parsing, they are caught in the catch block and logged to the console.
Output:
When you run the above code, it will fetch the data from the API and then print the URLs of all the country flags that are available in the response data. Each URL corresponds to the flag of a particular country in the API dataset.

This approach assumes that each country object in the API response has a flags property containing a png URL for the flag. It's a practical way to fetch and display specific data (in this case, country flags) from an external API using JavaScript.

3. Use the same rest countries and print all countries names, regions, sub-region and populations

// Fetch data from the REST Countries API
fetch('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all')
  .then(response => {
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    // Parse JSON data
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Iterate through each country object in the response
    data.forEach(country => {
      // Extract and print country details
      console.log(`Country Name: ${country.name.common}`);
      console.log(`Region: ${country.region}`);
      console.log(`Sub-region: ${country.subregion}`);
      console.log(`Population: ${country.population}`);
      console.log("----------------------------------------");
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was a problem fetching the data:', error);
  });

3.Data Processing:
Once we have the JSON data (data), we iterate through each country object using forEach.
For each country object, we extract and print the country's name (country.name.common), region (country.region), sub-region (country.subregion), and population (country.population).

4.Error Handling:
If there are any errors during the fetch or parsing, they are caught in the catch block and logged to the console.
Output:
When you run the above code, it will fetch the data from the API and then print the details (name, region, sub-region, population) of each country in the dataset. Each country's information will be displayed in the console in a structured format.

This approach assumes that each country object in the API response contains name.common, region, subregion, and population properties. It effectively demonstrates how to fetch and display specific details from an external API using JavaScript.
